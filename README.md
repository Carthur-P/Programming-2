# Otago Polytechnic Bachelor of Information Technology
## Paper - Programming 2 (BIT - IN511001)
This repo is used to house all the small projects that I did during the Otago Polytechnic Bachelor of Information Technology Programming 2 paper. This paper was design to get us working with C# programming language to create Window form applications. All of the small projects developed throughout the course was done to get us to learn and use different programming concepts that were then later used to produce our two main projects for the course. These two projects are Breakout and Pac-Man, which can be found in their own repository in the link below.

Breakout: https://github.com/Carthur-P/Breakout  
Pac-Man: https://github.com/Carthur-P/Pacman

__Note__ that all the project should have a .exe executable file in their home directory that will run the application. If they do not have the executable file in their home directory, the file can be found in the directory (project-name/project-name/bin/Debug/project-name.exe). Alternatively, all the projects can be open in Visual Studio 2017 where the built-in compiler can be used to launch the applications.

## Technologies Used
